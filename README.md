Hi!

- I'm currently working on [mu-graphql-example-elm](https://github.com/higherkindness/mu-graphql-example-elm)
- I'm currently learning PostgreSQL and Haskell
- I'm currently reading [Haskell in Depth](https://www.manning.com/books/haskell-in-depth) by Vitaly Bragilevsky 
- I'm looking for an opportunity to specialize in the backend with FP. Here is my [cv](https://logachev.dev).
